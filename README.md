# 🧠 CNN Retinal Disease Pipeline

**Automated Cataract and Glaucoma Detection via Fundus Image Classification using Deep Learning**  
*A comparative study of EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet-121 with transfer learning, data augmentation, and contrast enhancement.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the use of **deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** for classifying retinal fundus images into three categories: **Normal**, **Cataract**, and **Glaucoma**. It investigates two popular architectures—EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet-121—through a series of experiments involving transfer learning, preprocessing (CLAHE), dataset balancing, and custom classification heads.

## 📊 Key Features

- ✅ Multi-class classification of retinal diseases
- 🔁 Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs
- 🧪 Fine-tuning strategies and loss function experiments
- ⚖️ Dataset balancing and class weighting
- 🎨 Contrast enhancement using CLAHE
- 📈 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

## 🧪 Model Comparison

| Model          | Best Accuracy | Glaucoma F1-score | AUC-ROC (avg) |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **EfficientNetB0** | 83%          | 71%               | ~0.92          |
| **DenseNet-121**   | 81%          | 67%               | ~0.91          |

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

- Emphasize human-in-the-loop validation for AI-assisted diagnosis.
- Avoid potential bias due to small or non-diverse datasets.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR and HIPAA when handling medical data.
- Prioritize explainability and interpretability for clinical use.
